Graphical Password for the safety of Devices

The Circle of Life project is a novel solution designed to enhance security and privacy in password-based systems, specifically for UPI pin generation or mobile passwords. It addresses the issue of shoulder surfing, where individuals can easily observe and steal passwords. By using a graphical password approach, this project offers a more secure alternative. Users can create a unique password by selecting specific points on a graphical interface, making it difficult for others to guess or observe. This innovative solution provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access to personal devices and sensitive information. By eliminating the risks associated with traditional alphanumeric passwords, the Circle of Life project enhances user privacy and strengthens security measures. Its implementation ensures that only authorized individuals can access the device, mitigating the risks associated with password theft and unauthorized access.
